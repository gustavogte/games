## About Blastar

Blastar was a game written by Elon Musk in 1984 (at the age of 12).
The source code was published in a magazine and he received $500 for it.
Ashlee Vance's [Elon Musk:Tesla, SpaceX and the Quest for a Fantastic Future](https://www.amazon.in/Elon-Musk-SpaceX-Fantastic-Future/dp/0062301233) includes a reproduction
of the page from the publication where it appeared. 
This version is based on that listing.

Elon has since moved beyond 8-bit spaceships.
